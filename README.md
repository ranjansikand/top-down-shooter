# top-down-shooter
A quick prototype of a top-down shooter concept in Unity.

I had an idea of a FPS dungeon crawler, and wanted to test some things with pathfinding in Unity. This is my preliminary prototype, and can be played here:

The game is fairly simple, and just involves a procedurally generated stream of enemies to shoot. My high score was 37, see if you can beat it!
